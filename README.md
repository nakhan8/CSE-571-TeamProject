**Instructions to run code from scratch**

The Hybrid Logic agents reuses most of the code from "The Hunt The Wumpus AI project was developed at University of Arizona by Clay Morrison (clayton@sista.arizona.edu)" that we got in individual project 3.


Knowledge base implented in: "wumpus_kb.py"
Planning: "wumpus_planner.py"
Noise: "wumpus_agent.py"
Prerequisites: 
Python Installed 

1. Dowload the Project.
2. Extract the project
3. Run the project.
4. Execution command:python environment.py --ngames 150 --niter 40 --gridsize 4 4 --numwumpus 1 --numholes 3 --bullets 3
5. For executing the Hybrid Logic Agent in a noisy action model. Just run "python wumpus.py -y"

Noise: The agent goes Forward 90% of the times And takes either a left or a right turn 5% of the times respectively.
